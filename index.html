<h1>SSL Referee Box</h1>

<p>The referee box is part of the small size league’s goal of zero human input from competing teams during a game. The referee box is a simple program that lets a neutral third-party operator (a member of the officiating crew, not one of the playing teams) send the orders spoken by the referee directly to the teams’ software over a network, eliminating the need for teams to touch their computers to input those orders. In addition to simply sending commands, the referee box also acts as a helper utility for the referee by tracking time on the game clock, timeouts available to teams, goals scored, and yellow and red cards.</p>

<p>For information on using the referee box, see <a href="manual.html">the manual</a>. If you’re a team member writing code that receives orders from the referee box, you’ll need to know about <a href="protocol.html">the protocol</a>. There are <a href="faq.html">some frequently asked questions</a> about referee box commands and general gameplay, and of course you can <a href="download.html">download the referee box</a> to use locally in your lab.</p>
